# Anomaly-Detection-using-Real-time-Processing
Supervised machine learning techniques to find anomalies in real time data

We are seeing an enormous increase in the availability of streaming, time-series data. Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. 
One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised/supervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. 
This notebook implements supervised learning models to process data in real-time to learn continously.
